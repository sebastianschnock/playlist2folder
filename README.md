# playlist2folder
Shell script to copy all files from a m3u playlist to a folder

# Purpose
In the old tradition of creating mixtapes I was looking for a way to collect the songs from a mp3 playlist in one place (or folder). Often times your songs are all over the place and only your music player knows where those files actually are. With this you can collect the files from your playlist and use them for further processing, for example combining them to one big track.

# Installation
Get a local copy of this project:
```
git clone https://github.com/sebastianschnock/playlist2folder.git
```
Then add this folder to your path (eg in ```.bashrc```):
```
export PATH=$PATH:/PLAYLIST2FOLDER_BIN_FOLDER
```
Or you can link the script to ```/usr/local/bin``` or to your private ```bin``` folder (the possibilites are endless)
